    <h1>T.Slade Assignment 01: Personal Data</h1>
    <p>This page presents a visualization of the data generated by my Uber usage. The majority of the data was generated in Nairobi, Kenya while commuting to and from my workplace; the remainder was generated during a trip to the U.S. for a conference and a school event.</p>
    <div id="viz"></div>
    <p>The x-axis encodes the day of the week. The y-axis encodes the hour of the day (0-23, where 0 = midnight). Each dot represents a single ride.</p>
    <p>There are three basic forms of interactivity in this visualization: mousing over, mousing out, and clicking. Mousing over a ride displays a few details regarding the ride: the Make and Model of the vehicle, as well as the date of the ride. Clicking on a ride highlights all other rides that were taken in a vehicle of the same make. Mousing out from a ride restores all points to their original rendering and removes the ride details from view.</p>
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>The preponderance of Uber drivers in Kenya are driving Toyotas (blue). This is followed closely by Hondas (purple) and rather more distantly by Nissans (orange), Suzukis (brown) and Mazdas (maroon). There are very few Mitsubishis (brown) or Hyundais (blue), and only a single Renault (pink) or Ford (olive green). The dataset contains a single ride in a Kia (light blue) - based on the date, I know it took place while I was in the U.S.</p>
    <p>The visualization reveals that I only rarely take Ubers on Sundays, and never at all on Saturdays. This reflects the fact that my wife uses our vehicle during the week, but on the weekend we coordinate our activities and do not rely on Uber at all. The greater diversity of ride times on Mondays and the lack of Friday morning rides accurately reflect variance in my commuting habits driven by standing offsite meetings. The few rides that are extremely early and late (on April 24th and 28th) reflect the fact that the rides were taken in the Pacific Daylight Timezone rather than the East Africa Timezone where I reside. (All times were harmonized on EAT for this visualization's purposes.)</p>
