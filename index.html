    <h1>T.Slade Assignment 01: Personal Data</h1>
    <p>This page presents a visualization of the data generated by my Uber usage. The majority of the data was generated in Nairobi, Kenya while commuting to and from my workplace; the remainder was generated during a trip to the U.S. for a conference and a school event.</p>

    <p>The x-axis encodes the day of the week (1-7, where 1 = Sunday). The y-axis encodes the hour of the day (0-23, where 0 = midnight). The radius of each dot encodes the number of rides I took within that hour of that day (5px per ride).</p>
    <p>My commute in the morning is fairly consistent. I rarely go in before 6 am via Uber - in those cases, I'm going to a meeting, so I take a project vehicle or a taxi. I also rarely use an Uber to go in after 8 am - at that point I likely drive myself.</p>
